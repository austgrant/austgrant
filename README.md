## About

Hi, I'm Austin Grant, CTO at LUA, and also a designer.
I work on completely unique projects across multiple directions,  
from cybersecurity and privacy to AI and decentralized infrastructure.

I lead development teams and design system architecture.  
All of our products are built with a clear technical vision.

We don't follow templates.  
Each project requires its own approach, and I treat every one individually.

I enjoy solving complex problems and turning unique ideas into working systems ⚙️
